        <h2>LLM Research üìö</h2>
        <p class="research-description">
            I'm currently an undergraduate researcher with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their
            application
            in computer science education. Throughout my academic journey, I've been fortunate enough to publish
            several
            research papers on the topic, which have garnered recognition from fellow scholars and the wider
            academic
            community.


        </p>
        <p class="research-description">
            In addition to my own research, I've had the opportunity to lead a talented team of researchers,
            mentoring
            them as we collectively explore the cutting-edge realm of LLMs. My passion for this field is fueled by
            the
            belief that LLMs hold the potential to completely transform the way we teach and learn computer science,
            making it more accessible, engaging, and effective for everyone.


        </p>
        <p class="research-description">
            As I continue to delve deeper into the world of LLMs, I remain committed to advancing the field by
            exploring
            new and innovative ways to harness their power for the benefit of computer science education. I feel
            incredibly grateful to be part of this exciting journey and can't wait to see what the future holds for
            LLMs
            and the learning experiences they can help create.

                    successfully oversaw essential aspects such as acquiring sponsorships, handling logistics, and
                    maintaining budgets. Our collective efforts were reflected in the significant 100+ participant
                    increase from one semester to the next, making both events a remarkable success.

        <p>
            I am currently an undergraduate student at Temple University, pursuing my degree in computer science. Ever
            since I discovered my passion for technology, I have been captivated by its potential to solve complex
            problems and transform the world as we know it. One area I'm particularly passionate about is making
            computer science education more accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate enough to publish multiple research papers in the
            fields of Language Models and computer science education. I am incredibly proud of these accomplishments, as
            they reflect my dedication to advancing knowledge and understanding in these areas.
        </p>

            In addition to my research pursuits, I have developed a strong interest in both software development and
            data science. Through my involvement in various projects, I have gained invaluable experience and a deep
            understanding of how technology can be applied to tackle real-world problems. These projects have allowed me
            to grow and refine my skills, fueling my drive to learn even more and push the boundaries of what is
            possible.

            As I continue to explore the ever-evolving world of computer science, I am constantly reminded of the power
            and potential that technology holds. I am excited to see where my journey takes me and am committed to using
            my knowledge and skills to create a better, more inclusive future for everyone.
